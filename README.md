<h1 align="center">Next Level Week #3 || Happy </h1>

<h2 align="center">About</h2>
   
   <p align="center">
      Happy project was developed during Next Level Week #3, provided by <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a>, from October, 12th to 18th.<br>
      The project was inspired by brazilian children's day, same day the event started, thinking about how many children live in orphanages without a family or friends outside who come to visit them.<br>
      This event had a lot of exclusive, free content! Along with workshops, lives were held with professionals from different companies and backgrounds talking about: 
   </p>

   - "Accelerating Your Evolution" 
   - "Looking at opportunities" 
   - "The Stack Choice" 
   - "Up to two years in 2 months" 
   - "The extra mile"

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings</h2>

   <p>
      The week's challange was to propose not only programming, but also reflection. <br>
      For a final challange, each participant had to increment new functionalities to what was developed.  <br> 
      This was my first contact with the tools used to build Happy. I had never written a code in JavaScript, neither used SQL or any other database tools, or even had GIT installed in my machine. I only used GIT before on an online IDE to run staff checks in problem sets from a C course.
      My additions were: <br>
   </p>

- Added a page explaining about the project;
- A login page (though the authentication system is not implemented yet). The idea is to give more infomation credibilty to users by limiting those that have database writing access;
- A testimonials page (same as login, no back-end implemented.);
- Changed all texts to acomodade nursing homes as well as orphanages;
- License, gitignore, readme and demo files;

<h2 align="center">Considerations</h2>

- Doesn't work well on mobile;
- Without the implementation of an authentication system I wouldn't recommend putting it to work, it's too vulnerable to malicious users;
- Needs a way to change the stored data in case any institution needs it. e.g. changing phones or updating photos, or even closing.

<p>
   I spent a day's work trying to implement the back-end for the ideas I had with no success. Tough I believe I can do it with a little more study, there are other projects that
   require more imediate attention. I hope to return to it when I'm more capable. Until then, anyone may feel free to clone and implement any functionalities to this application. </br>
   That said, I think Next Level Week was a great dive into Web Development, lacking just of further explanation on how less straightforward parts of the project work. <br>
   After this week I feel confortable to read, change and replicate HTML and CSS codes to new pages, as my additions show. Yet, I feel the need of reaching for others lectures to really understand Node.JS and SQL.<br>
   Would participate again having time to<br>
